      "\n",
      "In this part, we won't get into any specifics of pylearn2 yet. We'll just discuss how to train a softmax regression model. If you already know about softmax regression, feel free to skip straight to part 2, where we show how to do all of this in pylearn2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What softmax regression is, and the math of how it works\n",
      "\n",
      "Softmax regression is type of classification model (so the \"regression\" in the name is really a misnomer),\n",
      "which means it is a pattern recognition algorithm that maps input patterns to categories. In this tutorial,\n",
      "the input patterns will be images of handwritten digits, and the output category will be the identity of the\n",
      "digit (0-9). In other words, we will use softmax regression to solve a simple optical character recognition\n",
      "problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have heard of [logistic regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). Logistic\n",
      "regression is a special case of softmax regression. Specifically, it is the case where there are only two\n",
      "possible output categories. Softmax regression is a generalization of logistic regression to multiple categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's define some basic terms. First, we'll use the variable $x$ to represent the input to the softmax regression\n",
      "model. We'll use the variable $y$ to represent the output category. Let $y$ be a non-negative integer, such that\n",
      "$0 \\leq y < k$  , where $k$ is the number of categories $x$ may belong to. In our example, we are classifying\n",
      "handwritten digits ranging in value from 0 to 9, so the value of y is very easy to interpret. When $y = 7$, the category\n",
      "identified is 7. In most applications, we interpret $y$ as being a numeric code identifying a category, e.g., 0 = cat, 1 = dog, 2 = airplane, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The job of the softmax regression classifier is to predict the probability of $x$ belonging to each class. i.e, we want\n",
      "to be able to compute $p(y = i \\mid x)$ for all $k$ possible values of $i$.\n",
      "\n",
      "The role of a parametric model like softmax regression is to define a set of parameters and describe how they map to functions $f$ defining $p(y \\mid x)$. In the case of softmax regression, the model assumes that the log probability of $y=i$ is an affine function of the input $x$, up to some constant $c(x)$. $c(x)$ is defined to be whatever constant is needed to make the distribution add up to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make this more formal, let $p(y)$ be written as a vector $[ p(y=0), p(y=1), \\dots, p(y=k-1) ]^T$. Assume that $x$ can be represented as a vector of numbers (in this example, we will regard each pixel of an grayscale image as being represented by\n",
      "a number in [0,1], and we will turn the 2D array of the image into a vector by using numpy's reshape method).\n",
      "Then the assumption\n",
      "that softmax regression makes is that\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\log  p(y \\mid x) = x^T W + b + c(x) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $W$ is a matrix and $b$ is a vector. Note that $c(x)$ is just a scalar but here I am adding it to a vector.\n",
      "I'm using numpy broadcasting rules in my math here, so this means to add $c(x)$ to every element of the vector.\n",
      "I'll use numpy broadcasting rules throughout this tutorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "$W$ and $b$ are the parameters of the model, and determine how inputs are mapped to output categories. We usually call $W$ the \"weights\" and $b$ the \"biases.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By doing some algebra, using the constraint that $p(y)$ must add up to 1, we get\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ p(y \\mid x) = \\frac { \\exp( x^T W + b ) } { \\sum_i \\exp(x^T W + b)_i } = \\text{softmax}( x^T W + b) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $\\text{softmax}$ is the [softmax activation function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_activation_function).\n",
      "\n",
      "## The basic theory of how softmax regression training works\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the softmax model will only assign $x$ to the right category if its parameters have been adjusted to make them specify the right mapping. To do this we need to train the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea is that we have a collection of training examples, $\\mathcal{D}$. Each example is an (x, y) tuple. We will fit\n",
      "the model to the training set, so that when run on the training data, it outputs a good estimate of the probability distribution\n",
      "over $y$ for all of the $x$s. \n",
      "\n",
      "One way to fit the model is [maximum likelihood estimation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood). Suppose we draw a category variable $\\hat{y}$ from our model's distribution $p(y \\mid x)$ for every training example independently. We want to\n",
      "maximize the probability of all of those labels being correct. To do this, we maximize the function\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ J( \\mathcal{D}, W, b) = \\Pi_{x,y \\in \\mathcal{D} } p(y \\mid x ). $$\n",
      "\n",
      "That function involves lots of multiplication, of possibly very small numbers (note that the softmax activation function guarantees none of them will ever be exactly zero). Multiplying together many small numbers can result in numerical underflow.\n",
      "In practice, we usually take the logarithm of this function to avoid underflow. Since the logarithm is a monotically increasing\n",
      "function, it doesn't change which parameter value is optimal. It does get rid of the multiplication though:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ J( \\mathcal{D}, W, b) = \\sum_{x,y \\in \\mathcal{D} } \\log p(y \\mid x ). $$\n",
      "\n",
      "Many different algorithms can maximize $J$. In this tutorial, we will use an algorithm called [nonlinear conjugate gradient descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_method) to minimize $-J$. In the case of softmax regression, maximizing $J$ is a [convex optimization problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization) so any optimization algorithm\n",
      "should find the same solution. The choice of nonlinear conjugate gradient is mostly to demonstrate that feature of pylearn2.\n",
      "\n",
      "One problem with maximium likelihood estimation is that it can suffer from a problem called [overfitting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). The basic intuition is that the model can memorize patterns in the training set that are specific to the training examples, i.e. patterns that are spurious and not indicative of the correct way to categorize new, previously unseen inputs. One way to prevent this is to use [early stopping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping).\n",
      "Most optimization methods are iterative, in that they try out several values of $W$ and $b$ gradually looking for the best one.\n",
      "Early stopping refers to stopping this search before finding the absolute best values on the training set. If we start with\n",
      "$W$ close to the origin, then stopping early means that $W$ will not travel as far from the origin as it would if we ran\n",
      "the optimization procedure to completion. Early stopping corresponds to assuming that the correlations between input features and output categories are not as strong as pure maximum likelihood estimation would determine them to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to pick the right point in time to stop, we divide the training set into two subsets: one that we will actually train on,\n",
      "and one that we use to see how well the model is generalizing to new data, then \"validation set.\" The idea is to return the model\n",
      "that does the best at classifying the validation set, rather than the model that assigns the highest probability to the training\n",

      "it's easier to just do everything in python though.\n",

      "YAML allows the definition of third-party tags that specify how the YAML string should be deserialized, and pylearn2 has a\n",

      "that returns an object. Usually this will just be a class name.\n",

      "In this tutorial, we will train our model on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) dataset.\n",

In this case, we use a dictionary to make multiple, named monitoring datasets.\n",

In this case, we use \"valid_y_misclass\", which is the rate at which the model mislabels examples on the validation set. MonitorBased has some other arguments that we don't bother to specify here, and just use the defaults.
