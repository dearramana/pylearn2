                For example, an intractable cost may return a sampling-based
                approximation to its gradient.
            updates:
                a dictionary mapping shared variables to updates that must

                gradients.
                The parameters should never appear in the updates dictionary.
                This would imply that computing their gradient changes
                their value, thus making the gradient value outdated.
